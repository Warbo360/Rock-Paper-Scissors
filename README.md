# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A Rock-Paper-Scissors game following the curriculum offered by The Odin Project, the following is the overall plan of execution of the program.

1-1: This is with accordance of the instructions laid out by TOP (The Odin Project) where I will come up with the first iteration of the rock-paper-scissors game and 1-2 will be implementing that into a loop for a best of 5 series against the computer. Idea is that the user inputs an option of rock, paper, or scissors after the computer has already randomly picked an option. After the program will then compare the two choices and determine a winner and either output a winning statement to the user if they have won and vice versa. Checklist of actions to take place for 1-1:

    1-1a. User is met with option to start game with a button press or starting the game by typing one of the available inputs

    1-1b. Once user starts the game with either method, computer randomly picks an option. 

    1-1c. User is prompted with the three options needing to type in one of the options (need to make itn not case sensitive).

    1-1d. Program compares the two options and determines a winner 

    1-1e. User is met with a winning or losing statement depending on the outcome from step 3.

1-2: This step involves implementing a loop of the steps in 1-1 to make it a best of nine series against the computer with the steps as follows:

    1-2a. After step 1-1e occurs, if the user or computer has not won five games in the loop, have the computer auto picks an option again for the next game iteration

    1-2b.A prompt for the user user to once again click one of the three options 

    1-2c. Step 1-1d through 1-1e again until the user or computer wins five games in the loop, up to a nine game max.

    1-2d. User is propmted with a winning or losing statement for the series overall that is unique from the statement given in 1-1e which is for an individual round.

    1-2e. A prompt for the user to start another best of nine series again.
